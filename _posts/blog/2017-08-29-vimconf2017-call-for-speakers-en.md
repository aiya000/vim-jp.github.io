We are looking for some VimConf 2017 speakers!

Topics to submit can be the latest Vim economics, your own Vim plugin,
tips for Vim beginners, or even a missionary activity as another text editor.
This is a rare and big Vim opportunity to have Vim fun.
Please do not hesitate submitting your proposals to VimConf 2017  to talk!

~~Call for proposal form~~ (We stopped accepting applications. Thank you!)

Happy Vimming!
