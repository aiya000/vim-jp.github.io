<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC-9bIVq-v-YQnPAeLVbyKQ3xso3Q6Cs8p8X5tdBIDU13TYw/viewform>

* Deadline: Monday 2018-08-13 11:00pm JST
* We plan reviewing and announcing selected speakers at the end of August 2018.
    * Accepted speakers can attend VimConf 2018 for free
* You can submit more than 1 proposals. Also you can keep editing or removing after the submitting, until the deadline
    * We recommend you to submit your draft first, and improve it during the month.
* The talk time slots are 20min and 30min including Q&A
* The vocal language in the speech must be either English or Japanese
    * English is recommended since this is an international conference
* See [how were the talks last year](https://vim-jp.org/blog/2018/04/23/publishing-vimconf2017-videos.html) for your reference.
* It's highly possible that the VimConf tickets can be sold out pretty quickly like last year. One of the safest way to join VimConf is to be accepted as a speaker.
* We'll call for 5min lightning talk proposals later. Lightning talk speakers need to buy a VimConf 2018 ticket in advance.
